	<dcterms:abstract xml:lang="en_US">In this paper, we study the effect of Web environment temporal background in
		pre-dicting e-commerce item sales, especially those in temporary sales. Temporary sales nowadaysare a popular
		strategy for quickly clearing inventories. For traditional recommender systems,predicting the sales of an item
		is done based on its past purchase records. For temporarysales items, however, such records are not available.
		In order to make recommendation forsuch items, contextual information, such as product descriptions, is usually
		used. We investi-gate whether temporal background in the Web environment can be additional useful
		contextualinformation in recommender systems. It is assumed that items consistent with the temporalbackground
		would have higher demands. We propose a method for representing the temporalbackground using word embeddings of
		e-commerce activities and social media data, and eval-uate their effect on sales prediction. Through empirical
		analysis with real-world data, we foundthat temporal background does have positive effects for sales prediction.
		The findings in thispaper can be conveniently incorporated into future recommender system designs.
