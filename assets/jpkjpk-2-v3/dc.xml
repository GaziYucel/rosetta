	<dcterms:abstract xml:lang="en_US">The effects of pressed beet pulp silage (PBPS) replacing barley for 10% and 20%
		(DM basis) were studied on heavy pigs fed dairy whey-diluted diets. 60 Hypor pigs (average initial weight of 28
		kg), 30 barrows and 30 gilts, were homogeneously allocated to three exper- imental groups: T1 (control) in which
		pigs were fed a traditional sweet whey- diluted diet (the ratio between whey and dry matter was 4.5/1); T2 in
		which PBPS replaced barley for 10% (DM basis) during a first period (from the beginning to the 133rd day of
		trial) and thereafter for 20% (DM basis); T3 in which PBPS replaced barley for 20% (DM basis) throughout the
		experimental period. In diets T2 and T3 feed was dairy whey-diluted as in group T1. No significant (P&gt;0.05)
		differences were observed concerning growth parameters (ADG and FCR). Pigs on diets contain- ing PBPS showed
		significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) percentages of lean cuts and lower percentages of fat cuts. On the whole, ham
		weight losses during seasoning were moderate but significantly (P&lt;0.05) more marked for PBPS-fed pigs as a
		prob- able consequence of their lower adiposity degree. Fatty acid composition of ham fat was unaffected by
		diets. With regard to m. Semimembranosus colour, pigs receiving PBPS showed lower (P&lt;0.05) "L", "a" and
		"Chroma" values. From an economical point of view it can be concluded that the use of PBPS (partially replacing
		barley) and dairy whey in heavy pig production could be of particular interest in areas where both these by
		products are readily available.
